# Summary
  In Harris’ and Hochmuth’s digital humanities project, Network Effect, the project consists of 10,000 video clips, 10,000 spoken sentences, news, tweets, charts, graphs, lists, and millions of individual data points, presented in a **visualization environment**. The project varies in choosables topics such as “argue”, “kick”, “married”, “sleep”, “wave”, and many more in alphabetical order. Clicking on a topic word gives you a display of random, **rapid** audio and visual clips that are meant to **overwhelm** the viewer (headphones are recommended). It also displays the current number of people participating in that activity in the world; such as “1,473,383 people are currently getting married”. However, there is a catch to this project. Once Network Effect is open, the viewer only has about seven minutes to see the project. The seven minutes can vary depending on the average life expectancy in the viewer’s country (United States average life expectancy is 78.4 years - 7.84 minutes - 7:50 minutes to view).

# Features
  The project does a very good job at maintaining the viewers attention span. Many DH projects are long, written paragraphs and the viewer may get lost in all the information given to them. Network Effect is a quick-to-view project that only lasts about seven minutes, but those seven minutes are packed with audio and video clips. In the image seen above, the viewer is able to view the percentage of which gender is currently doing the activity, the rate of growth or decline of the activity since 1990 to 2008, CTV news updates on the activity, the current number of people doing the activity, and lastly, a random fact about the activity. These five subjects at the bottom of the screen are predominantly for the viewer to be entertained by these facts. The message of this project reflects on a deep meaning to humanity, but the way it is viewed is very simplistic which allows the viewer to **experience** the project with ease and comprehension. 

  Although the simplicity of the project allows for an easier viewing experience, this can also be the downfall of Network Effect and the message it’s trying to convey. The muscle of the project that relates to the message, which isn’t given until the end of the project viewing period, is the multiple audio and video clips. Although the random facts may be interesting, they are unrelated to the Network Effect’s message. Another aspect of the project that is unrelated to the message is the chooseable topic activities such as “FLY”. However, this may be intentional because the information that can be found on the internet is also very **erratic**.

# Reflection
  As the overwhelming amount of topics, visuals, and audio are displayed, there is a timer in the top right corner counting down from the seven minutes that is meant to induce the viewer in a state of anxiety, fear of missing out, and frustration to complete viewing the whole project. The point of this is to simulate the effect of browning the web on humanity. The web is full of alluring information, but in the end it fails to give humanity happiness, growth, and wisdom. Instead, as a society it can cause us to feel **distracted**, anxious, self conscious, and **disconnected from reality**. The internet is a life changing tool that can benefit us, but the ease of overuse and addiction it has on people is similar to a drug. People spend hours of their day visiting popular apps, websites, and social media networks that can easily steal our attention in hope to fill a void in our life. The shallowest void will not be fulfilled by the web, instead, humanity needs time and silence away from the internet to reconnect who we truly are. For this reason, the creators of Digital Effect did not intend to engage new audiences to their site. Instead, their goal is encourage their viewers to spend less time on the internet. When the project viewing timer runs out, the viewer is taking to another screen full of clouds and the peaceful sound of a tebetan singing bowl with a quote by [Carl Jung](Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) in the center of the screen that reads, “Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.”
