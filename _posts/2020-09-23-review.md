# Summary
  In Harris’ and Hochmuth’s digital humanities project, *Network Effect*, the project consists of 10,000 video clips, 10,000 spoken sentences, news, tweets, charts, graphs, lists, and millions of individual data points, presented in a **visualization environment**. The project varies in choosables activity topics such as “argue”, “kick”, “married”, “sleep”, “wave”, and many more that are ordered alphebetically. Clicking on an activity gives you a display of random, **rapid** audio and visual clips that are meant to **overwhelm** the viewer (headphones are recommended). It also displays the current number of people participating in that activity in the world; such as “1,473,383 people getting married now”. However, there is a catch to this project. Once *Network Effect* is open, the viewer only has about seven minutes to see the project. The seven minutes can vary depending on the average life expectancy in the viewer’s country (United States average life expectancy is 78.4 years - 7.84 minutes - 7:50 minutes to view).

# Features
  The project does a very good job at maintaining the viewers attention span. Many DH projects are long, written paragraphs that the viewer may get lost in because of all the information given to them. *Network Effect* is a quick-to-view project that only lasts about seven minutes, but those seven minutes are packed with audio and video clips. In the image seen below, the viewer is able to view the percentage of which gender is currently doing the activity, the rate of growth or decline of the activity since 1990 to 2008, CTV news updates on the activity, the current number of people doing the activity, and lastly, a random fact about the activity. These five subjects at the bottom of the screen are predominantly for the viewer to be entertained by these facts. The message of this *Network Effect* reflects on a deep meaning to humanity, but the way that it is viewed is very simplistic which allows the viewer to **experience** the project with ease and comprehension. 

  Although the simplicity of the project allows for an easier viewing experience, this may also be the downfall of *Network Effect* and the message it’s trying to convey. The muscle of the project that relates to the message, which isn’t given until the end of the project viewing period, is the multiple audio and video clips. Although the random facts may be interesting, they are unrelated to *Network Effect’s* message. Another aspect of the project that is unrelated to the message is the chooseable topic activities such as “FLY”. However, this may be intentional because the information that can be found on the internet is also very **erratic**.

# Reflection
  As the overwhelming amount of topics, audio, and visuals are displayed, there is a timer in the top right corner counting down from the seven minutes that is meant to induce the viewer in a state of anxiety, fear of missing out, and frustration to complete viewing the whole project. The point of this is to simulate the effect of browsing the web. The web is full of alluring information, but in the end it fails to give humanity happiness, growth, and wisdom. Instead, it can cause us to feel **distracted**, anxious, self conscious, and **disconnected from reality**. The internet is a life changing tool that can benefit us, but the ease of overuse and addiction it has on people is similar to a drug. The shallowest void in someone will not be fulfilled by the internet. Humanity needs time and silence away from the internet to reconnect with who they truly are. For this reason, the creators of *Digital Effect* did not intend to engage new audiences to their site. Instead, their goal is encourage their viewers to spend less time on the internet. When the project viewing timer runs out, the viewer is taken to another screen full of clouds and the peaceful sound of a [tebetan singing bowl](Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6QTdvbu0uI) with a quote by [Carl Jung](Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) that reads: **“Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.”**
