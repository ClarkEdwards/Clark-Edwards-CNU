# Academic & Career
… and I am currently a junior working towards a degree in Marketing from Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. My future career goal is to work as a market research analyst with aspects in social media marketing. 

I am interested in the process of business decision making through the use of modern technology with the ever increasing information available. Recently in May of 2020, I took a maymester course called Applied Business Statistics that taught statistical methods using R studio. This is a program that uses the programming language “R” for **statistical computing** and graphics. It was during this course that I realized the power of combining modern technology with statistics to help understand business challenges and help make important decisions relating to the field of business.

During this recent summer of 2020, I was given the opportunity to intern at the Humane Society of Loudoun County as one of their social media marketers. In this internship, I created a new **social media outlet** for them using the current popular app, TikTok, that allowed employees and interns from the marketing team to post foster animal videos seeking to attract adopters to the [HSLC website](https://humaneloudoun.org/).

# Personal Interests
In my free time, I enjoy hobbies such as working out at the gym, playing soccer for one of CNU’s intramural teams, and longboarding down the hills around my house partly because of the health benefits each activity has to offer. During my senior year of high school, I accomplished being the 800m state champion for track, then I continued my running career at CNU up until sophomore year to focus on alternate directions of my life. When CNU’s Covid-19 guidelines pass, I plan to try out for the club soccer team and join the marketing club.

Away from college at home, I have a cat named Buttons that unfortunately isn’t fond of me, but I still enjoy her company. I have a great interest in traveling to many parts of the world such as Hawaii, Australia, Thailand, Germany, and even Antarctica via cruise; once I have a better income than a college student budget of course.
