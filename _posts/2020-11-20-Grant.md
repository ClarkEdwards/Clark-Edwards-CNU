#Introduction

NASA has commissioned a total of 135 space shuttle missions and has sent 833 astronauts into space. However, since the 1960s, spaceflight missions have resulted in more than 20 accidental astronaut deaths. Traveling to space is a daunting assignment, so the astronauts chosen for this task have to be the best of the best physically but more importantly mentally. Astronauts that have been to the International Space Station (a modular space station in low Earth orbit) have left behind viewable journals that contain multiple entries that describe their experiences during their missions. These astronauts differ in gender, race, and military/civilian background. My digital humanities project focuses on the personal experience of American astronauts to educate the public about what thoughts go on in an astronaut’s head while in space.

# Research
The first source I used for information was *The Guardian* which provided a list of every American astronaut since the first selection in 1959. This list included the name of the astronaut, the selection year, the number of flights, their status (former vs current), whether they have a military or civilian background, sex, missions they participated in, and total hours of space time. It can be seen that astronauts from America have been predominantly men and from a military background because of NASA’s close association to the military. The information from this list helped me determine the stats about the following source I used.

The majority of my idea was inspired by the *Johnson Space Center* on NASA’s website. Journals written by various astronauts were publicized on this website so that the public may better understand the personal experience of several different astronauts. These journals include a collection of letters, reports, and other writings that reflect the astronaut's thoughts and feelings during the time they were in space. Some of the journal entries written were very poetic and eye opening to what it is like to have a point of view that is different from being on Earth. Below is a journal entry called “The Night Pass” written by Sandra Magnus, a current female astronaut with a civilian background that was selected in 1996.

# Differentiation
Although my grant will use these journal entries to show the experience of American astronauts, my grant differentiates from the Johnson Space Center website. First off, my grant will provide factual information about each astronaut featured in my digital humanities project. These facts will come straight from *The Guardian*. This will include the previously mentioned information about the astronaut’s selection year, background, sex, etc. My grant will also include a mapping project of where each astronaut is from in the United States and the locations they’ve launched from.

# Reflection
My grant has changed many times and will most likely alter again in the future. My first idea for my grant was about the Hubble Space Telescope, but it relied too heavily on the science component rather than the humanities. As I continued to ponder on what I wanted my grant to be about, I landed on the topic of astronauts. Doing some research eventually led me to focus on their writings in regard to their space experience.
