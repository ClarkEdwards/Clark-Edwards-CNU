  NASA has commissioned a total of 135 space shuttle missions and has sent 833 astronauts into space. However, since the 1960s, spaceflight missions have resulted in more than 20 accidental astronaut deaths. Traveling to space is a daunting assignment, so the astronauts chosen for this task have to be the best of the best physically, but more importantly mentally. Astronauts that have been to the [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) (a modular space station in low Earth orbit) have left behind viewable journals that contain multiple entries that describe their experiences during their missions. These astronauts differ in gender, race, military/civilian background, and more. My digital humanities project focuses on the personal experience of American astronauts to educate the public about what thoughts go on in an astronaut head while in space.

  In my Grant Process One blog, I explained that my digital humanities project would consist of a mapping project of the locations of where each astronaut has launched from in the United States. Originally, my project would also have journal entries for some of the astronauts along with a few facts about the astronaut such as the astronaut’s selection year, background, gender, etc. Since the Grant Process One blog, I have made a few changes to help the viewer better understand how my project would work in greater detail.

  When the project is opened, a view of the United States will take up the majority of the screen. On the map of the United States, there will be multiple data points that specify where each NASA launch has taken place. Next to each point there will be the name of the launch location, which will be clickable. Once a launch location has been clicked, the project will zoom into that specific location where a description and picture of the launch facility will be displayed; along with a viewable video of a launch that has taken place at that location. Under the description, there will be a list of astronauts that have launched from the chosen location. Next to the astronaut's name there will be a small picture (about the size of the text box) of the astronaut. Once the astronaut’s name or picture has been clicked, the project will zoom out of Earth and into space. Depending on where the Astronaut has traveled, the project will either show the International Space Station or Earth’s moon as the background. On the foreground there will be the astronaut's picture and name in much bigger font along with a description of the chosen astronaut. This description will include the astronaut’s selection year, background, how much time they’ve spent in space, and a few other facts about them that will come from *The Guardian*.

  In the top right corner of the astronaut's summary slide, there will be an icon of a journal. Clicking on the journal icon will transition the astronaut’s summary slide to a journal entries list that the astronaut has written. There will be about five to ten different journal entries that the viewer will be able to click on for that specific astronaut. These journal entries will allow the viewer to read through multiple paragraphs of what that chosen astronaut has experienced during their missions and their thoughts during their time in space. These journal entries come from [The Johnson Space Center website](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/astronauts/journals_astronauts.html), however, not every astronaut on this digital humanities project will have a viewable journal.

  My original idea for my grant was a mapping project of the Hubble Space Telescope, but it relied too heavily on the science component rather than the humanities. This transitioned my grant to a mapping project of astronauts, however, my grant wasn’t very detailed. After a couple of weeks of working through my second process, I’m proud of how far my grant has evolved. The purpose of my grant is to educate the general public, but more specifically, educate any astronaut or space enthusiast about the experiences American astronauts go through during their time in space and how they cope with their missions mentally.
